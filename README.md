# “Open the pod bay doors HAL”

CocoaPods plug-in to open a workspace. If no workspace is found, the command
continues up the directory tree looking for one to open.

Also adds the ability to install pods and then open the workspace. Useful when
modifying your `Podfile`.

## Installation


Install the gem:

    $ gem install cocoapods-open

## Usage

Open the workspace in Xcode

    pod open

Open the workspace in AppCode

    pod open -a

Install pods and then open the workspace (`pod install && pod open`)

    pod reinstall
